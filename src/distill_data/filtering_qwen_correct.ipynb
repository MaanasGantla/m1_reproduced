This task involves a voluntary contraction of the biceps brachii muscle. It is expected that the motor units in the biceps brachii will recruit in a specific order: first, the small motor units (those with the lowest threshold for activation) will be recruited to generate the initial force. As the force requirement increases, larger motor units with higher thresholds will also be recruited to complement the force output. By the end of this task, all appropriate motor units will have been recruited to meet the strength requirement, leading to significant muscle tension.\\n- **Phase 2 (Cardiac muscle activation):** In the second phase, the participant is performing burpees, which elevate the heart rate to 150 bpm. The cardiac muscle is involuntary and does not exhibit the same order-of-recruitment pattern as skeletal muscles. However, under constant demand, cardiac myocytes will maintain contractile efficiency through metabolic adjustments rather than through varying the motor unit recruitment pattern.\\n- **Phase 3 (Gastrocnemius stimulation):** In the third phase, electrical stimulation is applied to the gastrocnemius muscle with a frequency of 50 Hz. At this frequency and voltage, it is likely to generate a fused tetanic contraction, where individual muscle fibers and motor units fire near synchronously, leading to a sustained and high level of muscle tension.\\n\\nGiven these points, the most accurate statement is:\\n- **B. Recruitment of large motor units followed by small motor units in experiment 1:** This correctly describes the expected motor unit recruitment pattern during the initial voluntary activation of the biceps muscle in the first phase.',\n",

       " 'qwen_32b-model_answer_string': \"In analyzing the phases and respective muscles of interest in the experiment:\\n\\n- **Phase 1**: With the participant lifting a 5 lb weight with his left hand, the primary muscle examined is the biceps. The type of contraction expected here is a tetanic contraction, possibly progressing to a fused tetanic contraction depending on the intensity and duration of the contraction. However, for a weight that is not overly heavy for a healthy 22-year-old, the recruitment is expected to start with smaller motor units before potentially engaging larger motor units for sustained or increased intensity.\\n\\n- **Phase 2**: The focus shifts to the participant's heart rate at 150/min from performing 20 burpees, which makes the cardiac muscle the muscle of interest. During this intense cardio phase, the cardiac muscle adjusts its contractility without the same concept of motor unit recruitment patterns seen in skeletal muscles, but there is an increase in myocardial work, which also reflects an increase in tension (in terms of cardiac output and pressure).\\n\\n- **Phase 3**: The gastrocnemius is stimulated electrically at a frequency of 50 Hz. At this high frequency, the expected outcome is a fused tetanic contraction, where there is muscle contraction without relaxation, representing a maximal effort from the muscle.\\n\\nGiven these explanations:\\n\\n- **A**: Fused tetanic contraction at the end of all three experiments – This is not the best answer because phase 1 (biceps in weight lifting) would not necessarily conclude with a fused tetanic contraction.\\n- **B**: Recruitment of large motor units followed by small motor units in experiment 1 – This is incorrect as motor unit recruitment follows a size principle, starting with smaller motor units.\\n- **C**: Increase of tension in all phases – This statement is too broad and doesn’t consider the distinct physiological mechanisms among the different muscle types and actions (cardiac vs. skeletal).\\n- **D**: Recruitment of small motor units at the start of experiments 1 and 2 – Correctly reflects the beginning phases of contraction in skeletal muscle, and though cardiac muscle contractility increases, it does not involve the same motor unit recruitment as seen in skeletal muscles.\\n\\nGiven these considerations, the closest correct statement would be:\\n\\\\boxed{D}\",\n",
